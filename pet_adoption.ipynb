      "Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, including the noise and outliers, making it less generalizable to new data. To avoid overfitting, techniques such as early stopping, dropout, and cross-validation are used. Early stopping monitors the validation loss during training and stops training when it stops improving. Dropout randomly drops neurons during training to prevent the model from becoming too dependent on specific neurons, thereby promoting generalization.\n"

    "print(\"Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, including the noise and outliers, making it less generalizable to new data. To avoid overfitting, techniques such as early stopping, dropout, and cross-validation are used. Early stopping monitors the validation loss during training and stops training when it stops improving. Dropout randomly drops neurons during training to prevent the model from becoming too dependent on specific neurons, thereby promoting generalization.\")"
